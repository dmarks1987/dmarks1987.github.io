			<h2>The Review</h2>
				<p>Now that we have that out of the way, let's get down to the overall review of the game. First of all, I'm not going to give it a number score because fuck that. I'm not IGN or GameSpot and I don't want you to skip to the bottom to TL;DR my page. To properly review Breath of the Wild, it's important to acknowledge its predecessors in both the Zelda series and the open-world game format as a whole. The game itself pays homage to the original title in the series, The Legend of Zelda, in that the player can tackle the game in whatever order they want. You might say the original Zelda was the first "open world" game ever. After the first game, however, the series took a more linear approach in which players were required to tackle dungeons in a specific order, using specific items, while presenting a more robust narrative. This format remained true from the second game in the series, Zelda 2 The Adventure of Link (1988), all the way through the penultimate--and in my opinion, overkill--realization of that format in The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword (2011). All the while, the open-world genre was growing and maturing since the first Zelda. In fact, this is the choice format for a big chunk of AAA titles these days, as we live in an era where content is king. Game series like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, The Elder Scrolls, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed and Fallout have exposed what is possible in the open-world format. Freedom, exploration, lots of content, and tight game play are things gamers have come to expect these days. Nintendo knew this when developing Breath of the Wild. Its clear they did their homework, but more importantly--made it a point to create something uniquely Nintendo with brilliant new features that will change not only the series and genre, but game design as a whole. And who could be surprised? Nintendo has done this several times in the past. Here's your TL;DR: The game is utterly breath (get it? you get it.) taking in almost every aspect.</p>

			<h3>Exploration at its finest</h3>
				<p>As you can see from the image, the world of Hyrule is huge. Everything you see in the picture can be explored by running, climbing, riding horseback, flying by hang glider and even "surfing" on your shield downhill. The first hour or two presents everything needed to explore the world. <font color = "red">You awaken from a 100 year slumber in the Chamber of Resurrection and discover a Sheikah Slate, which is used as a map and hub for your abilities. You are taught how to climb to get out of the chamber From there you run into an old man who instructs you to find and complete four shrines. In each of those shrines a new ability is added to your Sheikah slate and you're presented with a dungeon to solve with that specific ability. The abilities are magnesis, crynosis, stasis and two types of bombs. Magnesis allows the player to move metal objects, crynosis builds is blocks on the surface of water, stasis freezes objects in timeAfter the four shrines are complete, you meet the old man again who gives you your hang glider. From that point on, you're free to explore every inch of the map at your discretion. Now, you'll probably get your ass kicked if you venture into certain areas, but that's the beauty of the game.</font> If you want to fight the final boss from the get-go, you can! If you want to be a completionist and find every little collectible in the game, you can! If you just want to do the story elements, have at it! Nintendo does an amazing job of crafting a gorgeous world that begs to be explored. Every part of the map has its own sense of beauty that feels like a set piece. What truly frees the map up in comparison to other open-world titles is the act of climbing. In other titles like Skyrim you have huge worlds to explore, but are limited to where you can go by foot and horseback. Zelda solves this issue by allowing the player to climb virtually every surface in the game, besides inside of shrines, which are short, isolated dungeons where you progress by solving usually-clever puzzles to progress.</p>

			<h3>Why It's Still Zelda and Not At The Same Time, But Ultimately Is</h3>
				<p>Puzzle solving has always been a core gameplay element of the Zelda franchise. In all Zelda games prior to Breath of the Wild, the player was required to...</p> 
				<ol>
					<li>Adventure out to find a dungeon.</li>
					<li>Get the dungeon's unique item</li>
					<li>Beat the dungeon's puzzles which are specifically designed for that item.</li>
					<li>Beat the dungeon boss which is specifically designed for that item.</li>
					<li>Collect the dungeon's reward. Become Stronger.</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 1-5 until you come to an ultimate dungeon with a final boss which uses all items acquired and skills learned in the game.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>This is what we call the "core loop" of a game. In Zelda's case, I personally like throw it into the "get stronger" game loop category. I don't care if its Mario, Zelda, Tetris, Candy Crush, GTA, Pong, Poker, Chess, or Exploding Kittens--all games you play have a core loop. A "core loop" is an easy-to-understand repetitive process that keeps the player engaged, while not making the experience too overwhelming or bloated--and don't get me wrong, there are games that completely miss the mark on their loops. Sure, there are elements of every Zelda game that can be done outside of this core loop, but to progress in the game, the player is required to follow that loop. Well, when Eiji Aonuma, producer of Breath of the Wild, said they planned to break the conventions of Zelda, he wasn't kidding.</p>

				<p> See the first image above? That's the outside of a shrine. See the second image? That's the inside of one of 120 shrines sprinkled throughout Hyrule. <font color = "red">As state before, you acquire all the abilities you need within the first one to two hours of the game and are set free to do what you want, when you want. Well, each of these shrines presents the player with puzzles that use one to all four of the abilities. Not to mention, there are shrines designed as combat challenges and others that present the challenge outside of the shrine. </font>So, what does this mean for Breath of the Wild's core loop in particular? This is the part of the game that fascinates me the most because I actually haven't fully figured out a proper way to illustrate or label its loop. However, I am starting to believe that its loop is directly tied to your tasks and item management. There's so much to do and collect! Check out all the things you can do and collect!</p>

				<p>With this in mind, combined with the fact that your weapons break after a certain amount of uses, makes me believe that the insentive to explore is defined by not only the gorgeous sites and fun ways to move around, but by the fact that nothing is holy in the game. All weapons and shields break (except one) and your health recovery is solely dependent on your usage of materials, which you cook into tasty meals that also boost your stats to resist cold, heat, increase your stamina, etc. So to survive, you're literally forced into a loop where exploration becomes the key factor of surviving the game. I mean, since the first objective you get in the game is "Destroy Calamity Ganon", it is litereally DARING you to head straight to the final boss. Of course, if you attempt to you will probably be met with a terrible fate ;-) Anyone get that? No? Okay... Anyway, while the game lets you go wherever you want early on, that doesnt mean its going to be easy. In order to move around Hyrule with ease and less stress, your best bet is to explore, gather Korok seeds to inflate your inventory, find shrines to increase your health and stamina, defeat strong enemies to take their powerful weapons and discover locations that reveal parts of the story. So, my temporary analysis, that I'm postive I'll update in the future, illustrates the loop as such:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Adventure out.</li>
					<li>Get ass kicked.</li>
					<li>Adventure around to find better weapons and materials.</li>
					<li>Discover new thing.</li>
					<li>Get distracted by new thing.</li>
					<li>Stumble upon cool narrative sequence or set piece</li>
					<li>Get ass kicked</li>
					<li>Rinse and Repeat until you feel strong enough to Head to Hyrule Castle to face Calamity Ganon.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>For real, I want to keep writing this. I've actually been meaning to for a while and this was the perfect excuse to start doing it. However, I need sleep and it's Sunday night. I will probably update this as we continue to gain dope skills.</p>
